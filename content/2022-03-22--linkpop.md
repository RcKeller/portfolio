As a lead engineer for LinkPop, I led efforts to [bring the product to the market Q1 2022](https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/22/shopify-launches-new-linkpop-link-in-bio-tool-with-built-in-ecommerce-features/). After we went to market, we identified several improvement areas including our performance and time-to-load. To address these, we adapted [Hydrogen, Shopify's React library for react server components](https://shopify.engineering/how-we-built-hydrogen), so that it could be used to render Linkpop pages as abridged storefront experiences. This led to a ~80% reduction in initial time-to-load!
