A Network Auto-Provisioning system I developed while working for University of Washington IT, capable of automatically configuring and deploying network devices. This software suite iterates over devices once - the first iteration is part of auto-discovery and commits basic security policies, followed by directing the device to an API endpoint that will dynamically generate a configuration. In order to retain a human element to the process, an SSH connection is established with the newly configured device for a network engineer to approve staged changes, adding a human element of QA to the process.
