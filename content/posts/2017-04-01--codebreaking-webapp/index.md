Webapp built as an experiment with full stack development and containerized deployment w/ Docker. The objective was to develop a full web service that has a client, back end, and environment provisioning process that all existed independently, but could be built in one step.

Technologies:

* Front End: React w/ Redux store
* Back End: Go / Golang
* Environment: Dockerized Nginx
