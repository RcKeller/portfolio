A software suite used to crack and wipe network devices for UW-IT. SwitchPick is the lockpick to a network switch - attach it via a serial cable and it'll start a conversation, ID the device, and breach it. This was the project that set me down the path of infrastructure automation and a career in DevOps practice.
