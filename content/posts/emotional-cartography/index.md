Webapp for mapping emotions across the world, based on applied machine learning. I was a microexpression behavior analyst in my prior research days, and I wanted to develop an app that would demonstrate just how meaningful the implications of individual behavior can be.  This system leverages the [Microsoft-Oxford Emotion API](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/emotion-api/documentation) to analyze emotions from crowd photographs across the world in order to establish an emotional profile of an area. Is a particular city block exhibiting elevated levels of anger, sadness, or fear? Upload the data and you'll have your answer.
