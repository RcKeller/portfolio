The UW Student Technology Fee Committee is an entirely-student run organization that allocates roughly $5 million dollars across over a hundred student technology projects annually. Formed by the Washington State Legislature and UW Board of Regents, the STFC is a prime force for driving innovation via the student experience. Per the Open Public Meetings Act, the STFC maintains a high degree of transparency in both operations and engineering practices, and has open sourced their web platform.

When I joined the committee Spring 2017, I worked with the admin team to redesign the committee process based on feedback we had accumulated over the past decade. Our biggest challenges included:

- Addressing large security vulnerabilities and migrating away from depreciated technologies.
- Normalizing a database containing 10 years worth of data, with schema incongruent from year-to-year.
- Redesigning business processes and the application to handle edge cases.

In addressing these challenges, we also identified several key opportunities:

- The proposal process could be modified to include financial compliance and auditing requirements.
- Modifications to the proposal narratives could make them more compelling, leading to increased approval rates.
- Improving user experience would increase engagement, leading to more funded projects.
- Administrative dashboards could be incorporated and lower effort for the admin team.
- Modernizing the technical stack would make the webapp more robust and maintainable.

For these reasons, we decided to develop a brand new webapp and migrate - the [STF Refresh Project](https://github.com/RcKeller/STF-Refresh). Read the next article to learn more about the project, or choose a specific section from the sidebar.
