**Ali Shubber** - _Software Engineer at T-Mobile_

> Ryan is extremely innovative and in the early stages of his career. He joined my team from UW Temp Services to help with some rudimentary tasks but we quickly learned he could bring so much more value to the team. When his energy and talent were harnessed he helped his colleagues develop network automation tools, wrote his own scripts to improve his efficiency with assigned tasks and challenged network FTE to think outside the box. I'm excited to see where Ryan's journey takes him... the sky is the limit!
