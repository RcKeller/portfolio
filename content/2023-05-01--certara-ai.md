As an engineering lead at Certara A.I., I lead development of a SaaS suite of generative AI products used in the life sciences. Our product is novel in approach, as we offer trained and contextualized LLMs that can be used to process sensitive data that may include trade secrets, proprietary or personal health information, etc. Our clients include major pharmaceutical companys you have heard of, large federal organizations, and more (that I can't say!).
