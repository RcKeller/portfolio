History on Demand is a Node.js-based command line tool that uses web scraping to query Smithsonian museums for same-day entry passes. These passes go on sale around 6-6:30 EST and sell out in less than half an hour. History on Demand can be used to reserve passes automatically (for free exhibits) and begin the transaction for paid passes.

I am happy to admit that I've visited the African American museum three times using this program, which is the most in-demand museum at the National Mall. Highly recommmended.

Note, I am only including part of the source code in the GitHub repository. This is to prevent people from using it to DDoS the Smithsonian.
