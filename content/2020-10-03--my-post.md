As a frontend lead for The Washington Post, one of my first major initiatives was leading the development of a central hub for susbscriber-exclusive features. We created "My Post" in 2020 to serve as a centralized location for subscriber exclusive features and personalized content - with the intent of driving engagement. MyPost also served as a conversion point during the 2020 election, where we used it to promote content related to the very contentious US presidential election.

MyPost was the first Washington Post app to employ incremental static regneration (new at the time) via NextJS to re-generate content as articles were published on a rolling basis. This worked well for our use case because we'd cache and serve the most popular articles for most users, because we didn't have personalized content to serve non-subscribers.
