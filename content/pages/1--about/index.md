For the past five years, I have pushed myself to explore many technical verticals including quantitative science, web development, DevOps and cybersecurity. I began my career as a researcher in the midwest and moved to Seattle to gain industry experience and an advanced education, taking some time in-between to intern in Washington, DC.

I currently work as a Software Engineer for [Crossover Health](https://crossoverhealth.com), a VC-backed healthcare startup that provides on-premesis care for large companies like Microsoft and Facebook. My work is distributed between developing new telemedicine products, developing features for our existing applications, and security engineering.

What keeps me going is the drive to not just consume knowledge, but create it. As developers we are always on the forefront of the industry, creating new systems and experiences that drive social progress, and it's an exciting field to be in. Our work is a labor of love and I want to share that with everyone possible.

## My Mission

- To contribute to the greater web ecosystem
- To incept and disseminate new knowledge and practices
- To challenge my perspective and learn from colleagues
- To leverage technical skills for social good
