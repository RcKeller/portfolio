        <p>
          I&apos;m a Sr. Frontend Engineer @Shopify based out of St. Louis, MO.
          For the past decade, I have pushed myself to explore many technical
          verticals including quantitative science, web development, DevOps and
          cybersecurity. I began my career as a researcher in the midwest and
          moved to Seattle to gain industry experience and an advanced
          education, taking some time in-between to intern in Washington, DC.
        </p>
        <p>
          What keeps me going is the drive to not just consume knowledge, but
          create it. As developers we are always on the forefront of the
          industry, creating new systems and experiences that drive social
          progress, and it&apos;s an exciting field to be in. Our work is a
          labor of love and I want to share that with everyone possible.
