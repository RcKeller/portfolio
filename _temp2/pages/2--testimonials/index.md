> Ryan is skilled, driven, and a great teammate to have with you in the office or at the whiteboard. My team gave him a no-small task on the spot and he brought back to us a clear and concise solution within the week. Not only that, he provided descriptive documentation we still use to this day.

He, in addition to his duties for the project, took on the task of mentoring those in the team that needed it. Ryan is a very determined individual who will put in the necessary work and more to reach the team's goals. I am glad to have worked with him last summer!

> I have had the pleasure of working with Ryan on many different projects within the Informatics Program at The University of Washington. Ryan is an extremely hard worker who puts his everything in what he does. He is also very caring and considerate towards others and always asks how he can help others when they need help. Ryan is always helping out other students whether it’s in the classroom or right before an interview for an internship or a full-time role. Ryan has helped me in so many classes and has helped me with interview prep and getting internships and I enjoy working with him.

> I worked with Ryan on an internship project involving the MERN stack. His ability to not only understand the concepts required to complete the project, but also relay the necessary steps to complete the project to the rest of the team was very impressive. Moreover, I was extremely impressed by his willingness to do whatever it took to get the project working; whether it be long hours, learning a new tool, or mentoring other team members. Ryan would be a great addition to any team.

Over the years of knowing Ryan I’ve been extremely impressed with the growth of technical skills that he brings to the table when it comes to delivering excellent software. Ryan is the jack of all trades and I would highly recommend him to any team as an engineer!

**Ali Shubber** - *Software Engineer at T-Mobile*

> Ryan is extremely innovative and in the early stages of his career. He joined my team from UW Temp Services to help with some rudimentary tasks but we quickly learned he could bring so much more value to the team. When his energy and talent were harnessed he helped his colleagues develop network automation tools, wrote his own scripts to improve his efficiency with assigned tasks and challenged network FTE to think outside the box. I'm excited to see where Ryan's journey takes him... the sky is the limit!

**Shane McDowell** - *Technology Manager at University of Washington*

> Ryan serves as a technical lead for Cyber Operations Development and has distinguished himself with his in-depth knowledge and collaborative approach. His contributions have significantly improved the performance of his team and align well with the organization's mission.
