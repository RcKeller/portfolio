A portfolio I made for a client featuring page transitions and vector animations to create the illusion of space within flat materials. I decided to give [React JSS](http://cssinjs.org/react-jss/?v=v8.6.1) - I was not  impressed by it a few years ago, but back then there wasn't the infrastructure necessary to make such a solution feasible. It was fun to use this time around, but JSS still feels like treating the issues of CSS with a sledgehammer rather than a screwdriver. A preprocessor and methodology like BEM should be enough to make your styles scale well. Regardless, JSS is still a viable solution for many applications.
